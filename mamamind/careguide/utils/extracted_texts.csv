Get closer to nature We all live with worries and fears, uncertainties, losses that leave us sad and pressures that make us feel stressed. Nature can have a really calming effect on us. We have been living around other animals and plants for thousands of years. Some people say nature helps them feel calmer, more hopeful and less alone. Our research found that going for a walk was UK adults’ favourite way of coping with stress during the pandemic in 2020. In Japan, some people do “forest bathing”, which may improve their mental health. So going to a forest or wood and experiencing the different smells, sounds and textures may really help. To get the best out of nature’s healing effects, try tuning your senses to what’s around you – the trees, plants, birds and animals, for instance, and water such as ponds or the seashore. Take a deep breath and see how you feel. The idea is to get connected with your natural surroundings. Find out more about mental health and nature , including our guide Thriving With Nature , produced with wildlife charity WWF. More tips 2. Get more from your sleep Anyone who has struggled with sleep will know what a difference it makes to our bodies, minds and ability to cope with life. We all have times when we sleep badly, and some of us live in situations that make a good night’s sleep impossible. For many people, sleep is often the first thing that suffers when we're struggling with our mental health. Adults need between 7 and 9 hours' sleep a night, including enough dreaming sleep and enough deeper sleep. If you’re struggling with your sleep, think about trying a few simple changes. For example: Develop a relaxing bedtime routine to help you start winding down before you actually go to sleep Avoid TV and mobile screens, alcohol and caffeine before bed. This will help you fall asleep and stay asleep. You could also avoid vigorous exercise before bed. Go to bed and get up at around the same time every day, including weekends. For more suggestions, try this guide to sleep and mental health . It includes information about potentially helpful apps and getting professional help if self-help isn’t working for you. More tips 3. Keep moving Our bodies and minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health (it works the other way around, too). Moving our bodies – with sport, gardening, dancing, cycling, walking the dog, cleaning or going to the gym, for example – are great ways to improve our mental and physical health . Exercise releases “feel good” hormones that reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class or a group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health. We don’t have to be professional athletes, or sporty, to get the benefits of being physically active . From walking to dancing and basketball to the gym, the best exercise is simply the one we enjoy. More tips 4. Eat healthy food Food and drink affect our bodies, brains and mood – for good or bad. Sugary snacks and drinks can give us a temporary “high” or sense of comfort that can feel irresistible. But they soon leave us feeling exhausted or jittery. Caffeine in coffee, tea, or so-called energy drinks can also have this effect. A balanced diet with lots of vegetables and fruit is essential for good physical and mental health. How we eat is also important. Having meals with other people can help to grow relationships – with family, friends, partners, and colleagues. This is really important in protecting everyone’s mental health and preventing problems. Food can also get mixed up with our feelings . Some people over-eat or under-eat when they are upset. It may help to talk to someone we trust and get professional support if we need it. More tips 5. Be kind and help create a better world If you have ever felt lonely, you will know how much it helps to have even a small connection with someone else. Exchanging a smile or friendly words can be comforting and lift our mood. Research shows that being kind is good for both sides. Being kind can boost our mood, help us feel more capable, strengthen our connections with others and even make us cope better with stress. If you don’t know where to start, you could try small but meaningful acts of kindness, such as offering a smile or a few kind words to another person. You could make their day but also feel better for it - friendly connections with others are vital for our mental health . More inspiration about acts of kindness We can also help others by doing volunteer work and getting together with other people to work for good causes. These things can help us feel connected with others and the world around us. It can give us the sense that we can make a difference. All of this is good for our mental health. More tips 6. Be curious and open-minded to new experiences We can all get stuck in familiar ways, like how we spend our time and what we think about ourselves and the world. This can be self-fulfilling, with our expectations influencing what actually happens, for good or bad. For example, we might say to ourselves: “Things never get better” or “I’m useless” as a response to what others have said to us. It can help to notice these thoughts and try out new ones, such as “I can change things for the better” and “there is so much I can do”. Life can feel more interesting, lively and rewarding when we are open to trying new experiences and experimenting with how we do things. It could be as simple as what we have for breakfast or the route we walk with the dog. It could also need some planning, like an adventure holiday. We might find a new place that it turns out we love, discover a talent we didn’t know we had or meet someone new and important. 7. Plan things to look forward to Life throws all sorts at us, and during hard times, we may feel hopeless and not have the energy to plan for the future. Things to look forward to, including fun activities, can help us cope with difficult situations. Making plans for things we enjoy can increase our sense of hope, which is important for our mental health. Our plan could be for anything from small pleasures, like a cup of tea or your favourite TV programme or dance class, to a trip with family or friends, or seeing your favourite film, sports team or singer. Whether it’s a small or a big one, the important thing is to plan it. Decide what you’ll do, when and with who and, if needed, book it. It’s important to follow your plan – and repeat. 8. Learn to understand and manage your feelings Feeling very upset can interfere with our lives, making it hard to think clearly or work, relax, study, sleep or deal with other people. Many of us will know when we’re upset but not be sure what we’re feeling. Is it sadness, fear , shame, loneliness , anger or something else? We don’t always know why we’re feeling that way. It often helps to give our feelings our attention without judging them, without telling ourselves we’re stupid or weak to feel the way we do. It may seem strange and uncomfortable to do this. But practice and patience with ourselves will help. Naming what we’re feeling is also likely to help. So, we can say to ourselves: “I’m feeling really irritable today but also sad.” Another helpful step can be to work out what has led to us feeling this way – might it be a disagreement or disappointment that you’ve had? Some women might find that their periods sometimes (or always) affect their moods. Talking kindly to ourselves, in the same way, we might reassure a small child we care about, is also important. It can be very comforting. You might feel uncomfortable initially, but give it a go – it might just help. Some people feel better if they write down their feelings in a notebook or on their phone. You might want to think about how to protect your privacy before doing this. You could try repeating something positive about yourself a few times each day. (This is sometimes called a “mantra”. “I am on a journey, growing and developing”, for example.) Research shows this reduces negative thoughts and feelings. Some people also feel that an activity called “ mindfulness ” is helpful. Talking with someone else can also be helpful – and that’s our next suggestion… 9. Talk to someone you trust for support Many of us have learned to bottle things up inside us and try to ignore painful feelings. It can take a lot of courage to tell someone else how we’re feeling or what we’re finding hard, especially if we don’t usually do that kind of thing. Just talking things through with a person we trust can help and feel like a relief. Use your own words. It’ll make you feel safer and less alone, and that will help protect your mental health and prevent problems. Talking may also change how you see and feel about the situation in ways you find helpful. Another possible benefit is that talking may strengthen your relationship with the person you speak with. This will benefit both of you and make it easier for them to turn to you when they need support themselves. Information about talking with friends about your mental health Information about talking with a health professional about how you’re feeling 10. Be aware of using drugs and/or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings Many of us sometimes use drugs to block out “difficult” feelings such as sadness, fear or shame. No one wants to feel bad; for some people, drugs and/or alcohol offer temporary relief. Unfortunately, they don’t stop the feelings from returning and may make things worse or create other problems, including damage to mental and physical health, relationships, work, or study. If you think you may be using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, it may help to notice it without beating yourself up about it. Being understanding and kind to yourself is good for your mental health. A possible next step could be to talk with someone you trust or one of the charities that offer confidential, free information and advice, including how to reduce the harmfulness of using drugs. Have a look at Talk To Frank , for example. You could also look for other ways of coping with painful feelings, such as getting help with the situation causing them, if possible, and finding a trusted person to talk with. This could be a friend or relative, a colleague, a person working for a charity helpline, your GP or a counsellor. Many charities around the country offer low-cost or free therapy . Find more detailed information about getting help with your mental health from many potential sources. Some people find it helps to go to “anonymous” meetings, such as Narcotics Anonymous , to share with others who have/had similar experiences. Some of these meetings are also now online. 11. Try to make the most of your money and get help with problem debts Money problems can be unavoidable, and we may have no choice about being in debt. Fears about paying debts , bills and essentials such as food and electricity can be very stressful. If we feel responsible for sending money back home or are the only earner in our household, we may feel burdened and isolated. Feelings like this can make it harder to cope with everything, including the money problems themselves. There are things we can do to help prevent financial problems causing issues with our mental health. We might feel ashamed of what we’re going through, which may make it harder to tell anyone, leaving us feeling alone with it. The truth is, we’re never alone with money problems. Research shows they are one of the most common and serious sources of stress for many people. Even if our finances are impossible to change, sharing our fears with another person who’s not involved and who you trust is likely to help us feel less alone and overwhelmed. This may help us to see new ways forward. If we are struggling financially, including with debt, it can be helpful to talk about it with an expert at a charity that offers free money advice. They are very experienced with what can go wrong with people’s finances and what may help. It can be really helpful to ask for help before any debt becomes unmanageable. But getting help will benefit everyone. Here is a list of organisations that offer free advice about financial problems , created by the charity Money and Mental Health. Talking with one of these free, expert advisers could also lead to you finding out about new possibilities, such as benefits you’re entitled to, your legal rights, ways to reduce the size of your debt repayments and other ways to save money.

Here's what you need to know about postpartum nutrition in order to speed recovery and boost your energy. Back to Top In This Article Why is postpartum nutrition so important? What are the best postpartum foods? Sample postpartum diet meal plan Should new moms take postpartum vitamins? Top postpartum nutrition questions, answered You’ve delivered your baby, but that’s no reason to oust spinach or, really, any nutritional superfood from your grocery cart. What you eat still matters — for your own wellbeing and the health of your baby if you're breastfeeding. Fortunately, there’s more wiggle room when it comes to foods you can enjoy postpartum compared to your pregnancy diet ! Here’s what you should know about what to eat after giving birth, including the best postpartum healing foods and a sample meal plan to follow. Why is postpartum nutrition so important? Think about it: You carried a growing fetus — plus extra fat, fluid and tissue to accommodate the little passenger — for longer than the average Major League Baseball season. You powered through labor and delivery and, at last, the juggernaut is complete. But your energy is sapped and you might not be feeling your best right now. How you nourish your body in the postpartum period is important for your own health and, if you’re breastfeeding, for your baby’s growth and development. Here are just a few of the benefits of eating well post-pregnancy: It can speed your recovery. A nutrient-dense diet full of complex carbs, fiber, healthy fats and protein, plus adequate hydration, can help heal your body. A healthy postpartum eating plan is the way to go to stave off bone loss, replenish your iron stores, head off hemorrhoids and much, much more. It promotes milk production. What you eat and drink is super important for the quantity and quality of your milk supply . It supports overall wellbeing. A well-balanced diet can support the 24/7 stamina you’re going to need as a busy mom. That’s not to say you can’t indulge your sweet tooth or junk food craving! After nine months of disciplined eating, who wouldn’t want to treat themselves? In general, though, it’s a good idea to continue eating healthily. Continue Reading Below Read This Next Postpartum Recovery Timeline Your Guide to Sex After Giving Birth Postpartum Symptoms & Solutions to Get You Through Postpartum Recovery Timeline Your Guide to Sex After Giving Birth Postpartum Symptoms & Solutions to Get You Through What are the best postpartum foods? A postpartum diet doesn’t look remarkably different from a typical healthy eating plan. Fill up on the following, and you’re probably getting most of the vitamins and minerals your body needs. Vegetables, including leafy greens, bell peppers, broccoli, avocados, carrots, kale, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, celery, cabbage and carrots Fruits, like citrus, berries, mangos, melon, apples and bananas Whole grains, such as oats, quinoa, brown rice and whole wheat bread Lean or low-fat protein, including fish, poultry, tofu, beans, seeds, nuts, lentils, edamame and lean beef Low-fat or fat-free dairy, like yogurt, milk, cheese and eggs There are, however, a few specific nutrients you might need to monitor your intake of, including: Iodine. Many lactating women fall short of getting enough of this trace mineral , especially those who don’t eat dairy, shun table salt, smoke or eat a lot of foods that inhibit iodine intake (including certain cruciferous veggies). Iodine supports infant growth and brain development. Lactating women should get 290 micrograms per day, nearly double the pre-pregnancy recommended daily amount (RDA) of 150 micrograms. One-quarter teaspoon of iodized table salt provides 76 micrograms, but many brands of sea salt and Kosher salt don’t add iodine, so check nutrition labels. Good dietary sources of iodine include seafood, seaweed, milk, yogurt and cheese. Choline. This nutrient, present in breast milk, plays a role in babies’ brain and nervous system development. Lactating women need more of it, some 550 milligrams per day, to replenish their own stores and meet baby’s needs. The risk of getting too little is higher in women who don’t take folic acid supplements. Food sources of choline include meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, cruciferous veggies, certain beans, nuts, seeds and whole grains. Omega-3 fatty acids. Just as in pregnancy, lactating women should consume 8 to 12 ounces of fish per week. Opt for varieties low in mercury and high in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), such as salmon, anchovies, sardines and trout. DHA, in particular, is important for fetal brain development. It’s also important to stay well-hydrated whether or not you’re breastfeeding. Aim for eight to 10 eight-ounce cups per day, plus water from other sources like fruits and veggies, to keep you from getting dehydrated. Even if your baby has moved on to formula, you still need about eight to 10 glasses of water a day as part of your recovery from childbirth and for overall health. Sample postpartum diet meal plan If you’ve been paying attention to your diet in pregnancy, your fridge and pantry are likely stocked with many of the best postpartum foods. Here’s what a day of meals might look like: Breakfast. Oatmeal (1/2 to 3/4 cup) with low-fat milk. Add 1/2 cup of melon for extra vitamins, potassium and fiber. Lunch. Light tuna (3 to 4 ounces) made with celery and hard-cooked egg (for choline) on whole grain bread. Top with crispy romaine lettuce, a good source of vitamin A, and tomato slices for vitamin C. Note: Canned light tuna makes the Food and Drug Administration’s list of “Best Choices” of healthy and safe fish options. Dinner. Chicken or beef stir-fry. Combine 2 ounces of meat with 1 cup of veggies, such as broccoli, cabbage, red bell pepper and carrots, along with 1/2 to 3/4 cup of cooked brown rice. Snacks. Keep snacks in the 200 to 300 calorie range for an energy boost between meals. Try low-fat Greek yogurt with frozen berries and almonds; apple slices and popcorn; or a smoothie with yogurt, fruit and spinach or kale. Don’t forget to keep drinking fluids throughout the day, if not with meals then in between them. Should new moms take postpartum vitamins? Make a note to ask your doctor what kind of supplement, if any, is best for you. There’s no consensus on supplementation in the postpartum period. Some doctors recommend that women keep taking their prenatal vitamins while they’re breastfeeding. Even women who aren’t nursing might be advised to continue taking these supplements for several weeks after delivery. Others may suggest switching to a standard vitamin and mineral supplement. Top postpartum nutrition questions, answered Still have questions about navigating your nutritional needs? Here’s the scoop on eating after giving birth and while you’re breastfeeding. What foods should I eat when breastfeeding? When filling your plate , focus on three key goals: Quality of food choices. Choose a variety of lean proteins, fruits, veggies, whole grains and healthy fats. By sticking with natural, whole foods, you’ll get the vitamins, minerals and fiber you need to sustain your energy and keep your body well-nourished while you’re nursing. Contrary to what you may have heard, spicy foods, dairy, caffeine and certain vegetables won't necessarily make baby gassy , so unless your little one seems to be having a lot of gas or digestive issues, you don't have to steer clear. Sufficient caloric intake. Women typically burn 300 to 500 extra calories per day while breastfeeding (or 450 to 500 extra calories while breastfeeding exclusively), so keep that in mind and try to take in about that same extra daily amount to match. Adequate hydration. Whether you’re sipping beverages, slurping soup or munching on juicy fruits and veggies, you need to replenish your fluids so you don't get dehydrated, which can affect your milk supply. What foods should I avoid when breastfeeding? Many of the foods you shunned during pregnancy (raw fish, soft-boiled eggs, cold cuts and unpasteurized soft cheeses) can come back into the rotation. Organisms that cause foodborne illnesses don’t usually pass through breast milk, so feel free to enjoy some of the treats you missed out on for the past nine months. Is it safe to drink alcohol while breastfeeding? Abstaining from drinking is the safest choice while breastfeeding, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but alcohol isn’t forbidden. If you decide to drink , stick to light drinking here and there rather than heavy, frequent alcohol consumption (which isn't safe for you or your baby), and time it right. After one drink, you should wait four hours before breastfeeding or pumping to give your body time to metabolize the alcohol, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends. Otherwise, it could end up in your breast milk. So while an occasional glass of wine after you’ve nursed might be fine, moderation is key. Are my nutritional needs different if I’m breastfeeding twins? Moms who exclusively breastfeed twins need about 500 extra calories every day per baby. To achieve that higher bar, focus on eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated. It’s a good idea to track the number of wet or dirty diapers each baby produces each day to make sure they’re getting enough to eat too. Fewer than six wet diapers over a 24-hour period may be a sign that your baby is dehydrated. Should I adjust my diet so my baby doesn’t develop allergies? An allergy to breast milk is very rare. When it does happen, a protein in cow’s milk is often the cause. (Other potential allergens in your diet include nuts, peanuts, wheat and soy.) If milk allergy is suspected , your doctor may suggest eliminating milk from your diet for a couple of weeks to see if your infant’s symptoms improve. Keep in mind that breastfed babies are less likely to develop allergies than formula-fed infants. How much water should I drink postpartum? Make it your goal to drink around 96 ounces of fluids (including water, seltzer, decaffeinated tea and other unsweetened drinks, along with fruits, vegetables and other sources) each day while you’re breastfeeding. That’s about eight to 10 or even 12 eight-ounce cups from all sources, but you may find it easier to fill up a large water bottle two or three times a day. If you’re formula-feeding your baby, 80 ounces or about eight to 10 cups per day from all sources should cover your hydration needs . A healthy postpartum diet isn’t a panacea. Your overall health and recovery also depend on staying physically active and grabbing sleep when you can. Still, diet goes a long way toward healing your body and helping your baby thrive.

https://nichq.org/insight/better-sleep-breastfeeding-mothers-safer-sleep-babies,"Better Sleep for Breastfeeding Mothers, Safer Sleep for Babies","Better Sleep for Breastfeeding Mothers, Safer Sleep for Babies Skip to main content Insights Better Sleep for Breastfeeding Mothers, Safer Sleep for Babies When a mother or birthing person breastfeeds/chestfeeds, they release oxytocin , a hormone that soothes anxieties and helps induce a unique emotional connection to their newborn baby. Oxytocin, also known as “the love hormone,” packs a powerful punch that, while supporting healthy breastfeeding/chestfeeding, has one potentially dangerous side-effect: it can make people tired. “New mothers are sleep-deprived and understandably stressed,” says Michael Goodstein, MD, a neonatologist and safe sleep and breastfeeding/chestfeeding expert. “Add to that a state of hormone-induced calm and it’s not surprising that mothers struggle to stay awake while breastfeeding. Falling asleep is the natural inclination.” This inclination can become dangerous because it can result in accidental co-sleeping, a risk factor for sleep-related infant deaths. Acknowledging this risk alongside the significant health benefits breastfeeding/chestfeeding brings mothers, birthing people, and babies begs an all too common question for maternal health professionals: How do you realistically support tired and overwhelmed mothers and birthing people to breastfeed/chestfeed safely? Goodstein is a faculty expert on the NICHQ-led National Action Partnership to Promote Safe Sleep Improvement and Innovation Network ( NAPPSS-IIN ), which aims to make safe sleep and breastfeeding/chestfeeding the national norm. He says designating time to talk to new parents about their own sleep habits can help. “We can’t change mothers’ natural response to breastfeeding,” says Goodstein, “and we wouldn’t want to—oxytocin is incredibly valuable for mother-child bonding. But we can do a better job of helping mothers manage their stress and their sleep habits during those early months. And in doing so, we can reduce unsafe environments.” Interested in learning more about infant health, bedsharing, and breastfeeding/chestfeeding? Click here for a recent NICHQ article. Below, NICHQ’s NAPPSS-IIN team has identified three opportunities for health professionals to put Goodstein’s advice into practice, and better support healthy sleep habits, and create safe sleep environments for infants. Advise self-care Mothers and birthing people are often told to “sleep when the baby sleeps.” This makes sense in theory, but in practice can be a difficult behavior to adopt. It may be necessary to use naptime to take care of other tasks, and falling asleep on command can be difficult. In both cases, mothers and birthing people are left even more stressed and tired, and at a higher risk of accidentally falling asleep while breastfeeding/chestfeeding. “Along with advising mothers to find time to sleep, we need to specifically talk to them about the importance of self-care,” says Goodstein. “Chronic stress can exacerbate sleep loss, which then becomes a health risk for both moms and babies.” Goodstein recommends discussing alternative opportunities to help recharge, such as taking a walk outside while the baby sleeps in a carrier or stroller, exercising at home, or reading a book while the baby naps. These activities can give mothers and birthing people a mental and physical break that can be just as valuable as a couple of hours of sleep. Identify each mother or birthing person's support network Having a new baby doesn’t keep other obligations at bay for long. New parents are often left balancing the needs of their families, their jobs, and their homes, which can make for a seemingly endless day when you add in regular breastfeeding/chestfeeding. “Talk with mothers about who is going to support them during those early months,” advises Goodstein. “This may be a significant other, but help comes in multiple forms—friends, immediate and extended family, and support groups are all important resources that new moms can tap. By reviewing these options with mothers, we can help proactively alleviate some of the stress they’re bound to feel.” Having someone help with daily tasks—even seemingly small responsibilities, like doing a load of laundry or washing the dishes—gives mothers and birthing people precious time to sleep and engage in those activities that help them emotionally recharge. Discuss strategies for helping fussy babies sleep Does my baby feel safe? Are they hungry? Are they wet? These three questions can help mothers, birthing people, and caregivers address the most common reasons for crying babies. But once these issues have been resolved, they are often left wondering what else they can do. “We need to do a better job of helping moms and caregivers prepare for fussy babies,” says Goodstein. “By teaching families about successful soothing techniques, we can help both mom and baby feel happier and sleep better. Swinging motions that soothe babies, checking whether the baby might have been overstimulated by the environment, playing white noise and finding a change of scenery are all helpful strategies that care teams can discuss with families and help them go home feeling prepared.” During these conversations, Goodstein also recommends making time to highlight pacifiers. Since non-nutritive sucking is soothing for babies, pacifiers can be used to calm them between feedings, after the first few weeks of life once breastfeeding/chestfeeding, and breastmilk volume is established. Moreover, pacifier-use is known to significantly reduce the risk of SIDS . Remember though, Goodstein cautions, breastfeeding/chestfeeding should be well-established before families introduce pacifiers. Ultimately, Goodstein’s examples reaffirm the need to improve conversations with mothers about breastfeeding/chestfeeding and safe sleep, conversations that address individual circumstances and set feeding goals. Telling mothers and birthing people, ‘breastfeed/chestfeed but don’t bed-share’ isn’t enough; instead, it's more effective to work to understand what circumstances might make this difficult—such as sleep deprivation—and then develop plans of care that account for those barriers and reduce risks for sudden unexpected infant deaths.

Make sure your abdominal muscles have healed before you do any vigorous tummy exercises, such as crunches. Don’t be too hard on yourself if your exercise plans go awry – you’ll get more time to yourself as your baby settles into a predictable routine. On this page About postnatal exercise The benefits of postnatal exercise When to start postnatal exercises Types of postnatal exercises Breastfeeding and exercise Pelvic floor Creating time for postnatal exercise General exercise safety suggestions Where to get help About postnatal exercise Regular exercise has numerous health benefits, all of which apply equally to the new mother as at any other stage of life. These benefits include assistance with weight loss, increased aerobic fitness, social interaction and psychological wellbeing. Exercise after giving birth can also hasten recovery, and assist with muscle strength and toning. Always consult with your doctor or midwife before starting any postnatal exercise program. It is recommended that you wait until the 6-week postnatal check with your doctor before commencing a group exercise program, returning to the gym or personal training. Whether or not you are ready to exercise depends on individual factors, along with any postnatal complications. The benefits of postnatal exercise Exercising after you have your baby can improve your physical and mental wellbeing. It can: help restore muscle strength and firm up your body make you less tired because it raises your energy level and improves your sense of wellbeing promote weight loss improve your cardiovascular fitness and restore muscle strength condition your abdominal muscles improve your mood, relieve stress and help prevent postnatal depression . When to start postnatal exercises Gentle exercise (such as walking) can generally be started within a few days after giving birth, or as soon as you feel comfortable. Start when you feel up to it. Some women will feel able to start exercising early. Talk with your doctor about when is a good time for you to restart an exercise program. Six weeks after giving birth, most of the changes that occur during pregnancy will have returned to normal. If you had a caesarean birth, a difficult birth, or complications, it may take a little longer to feel ready to start exercising. If you did not exercise during pregnancy, start with easy exercises and slowly build up to harder ones. Keep in mind your lower back and core abdominal muscles are weaker than they used to be. Your ligaments and joints are also more supple and pliable, so it is easier to injure yourself by stretching or twisting too much. Avoid any high-impact exercises or sports that require rapid direction changes. Types of postnatal exercises Recommended postnatal exercises include: first few weeks postnatal walking pelvic floor exercises deep abdominal/core training. Post 6-week doctor or midwife check-up gym programs – ensuring to maintain posture, light weights, no breath holding swimming – once bleeding has stopped aqua aerobics – once bleeding has stopped yoga pilates low impact aerobic workouts. 12-16 weeks postnatal Can progress to higher impact exercise such as running and sport, as well as increase load and volume if pelvic floor is considered optimised. This should be assessed by a women’s or pelvic health physiotherapist. After 16 weeks postnatal Gradually increase exercise intensity at a rate that considers pelvic floor and abdominal levels, and any ongoing postnatal complications. Talk to your doctor or midwife for further recommendations and cautions. Breastfeeding and exercise Studies have shown that vigorous or regular exercise does not have adverse effects on a mother’s ability to successfully breastfeed as long as fluid and caloric intake are maintained. Some research, however, suggests that high-intensity physical activity can cause lactic acid to accumulate in breast milk and produce a sour taste a baby might not like. If you're breastfeeding, you can prevent this potential problem by sticking to low- to moderate-intensity physical activity and drinking plenty of fluids during and after your workout. Pelvic floor The pelvic floor may be adversely affected by pregnancy and childbirth. Most women are taught pelvic floor exercises during pregnancy and these are important to learn correctly and can be resumed immediately after giving birth. Pelvic floor exercises The pelvic floor muscles are tightly slung between the tailbone (coccyx) and the pubic bone, and support the bowel, bladder, uterus (womb) and vagina. Childbirth can weaken these muscles and cause problems, such as incontinence , later in life. To exercise them, you must first direct your attention to these muscles. To help you identify these muscles, they are the ones that you tighten to stop urinating (weeing). These exercises can be performed lying down, sitting or standing. Try to relax your abdominal muscles. Don’t bear down or hold your breath. Gradually squeeze and increase the tension until you have contracted the muscles as hard as you can. Release gently and slowly. Then perform the exercises, which include: Squeeze slowly and hold for between 5 and 10 seconds, then release slowly. Repeat 10 times. Perform quick, short and hard squeezes. Repeat 10 times. Squeeze, then clear your throat or cough lightly. Repeat 3 times. Aim for 5 or 6 sets each day. Creating time for postnatal exercise When you're caring for a newborn, finding time for physical activity can be challenging. Some days you may simply feel too tired for a full workout. But that doesn't mean that you should put physical activity on the back burner. Do the best you can. Suggestions include: Seek the support of your partner, family and friends. Exercise with a friend to stay motivated. Walking is a good way to get back in shape – all you need is a pair of comfortable shoes. It is free, and you can do it almost any place or time. You can also take your baby along. Include your baby, lying next to you on the floor, while you do abdominal exercises. Exercising 10 minutes at a time is fine. We know 150 minutes each week (as per the Physical activity and exercise guidelines for all Australians External Link ) sounds like a lot of time, but you don't have to do it all at once. Not only is it best to spread your activity out during the week, but you can break it up into smaller chunks of time during the day. Don’t be too hard on yourself if your exercise plans go awry. Just do the best you can and remember – you will get more time to yourself as your baby settles into a predictable routine. Tummy and pelvic floor exercises can be done while you’re doing other tasks, either sitting or standing. To help you remember, try performing the exercises whenever you do certain things, such as breastfeeding or driving the car. Walk your baby in the pram rather than use the car for short trips. Consider building up a home library of online exercise workouts. It might be a good idea to include a few shorter workouts (such as 15 or 30 minutes), just so you don’t always have to find a full hour or more to exercise. General exercise safety suggestions Be guided by your doctor or midwife, but general suggestions include: Wear an appropriate bra that offers good support. Don’t rely on your pre-pregnancy sports bra because your back and cup size are likely to have changed. Get measured for a new one. Your exercises should not hurt. If you experience pain or any other unexplained symptoms, stop the exercise and consult your doctor or women’s health physiotherapist. Be aware of postnatal depletion – a term used to describe symptoms that arise from nutritional depletion, sleep deprivation, and the significant changes of a new mother’s role, which can affect your wellbeing. Warning signs to slow down Don’t overexert yourself. Your body gives out warning signs if you are exercising too hard, and these signs may include: increased fatigue feeling unwell muscle aches, strains and pains breast lumps or tenderness colour changes to lochia (post-partum vaginal flow) to pink or red heavier lochia flow lochia starts flowing again after it had stopped.
